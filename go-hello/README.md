# Go Hello

## [Learn Go With Tests - Hello World](https://larien.gitbook.io/aprenda-go-com-testes/primeiros-passos-com-go/ola-mundo)

The first thing i learned here, always, write first your test and just after write your function/method/etc.\
The second thing is make the test fail to see if the error message is clear and found the problem right way and refactor the code to pass the test.
