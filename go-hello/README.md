# Go Hello

## [Learn Go With Tests - Hello World](https://larien.gitbook.io/aprenda-go-com-testes/primeiros-passos-com-go/ola-mundo)

The first thing I learned here, always, write first your test and just after write your function/method/etc.\
The second thing is make the test fail to see if the error message is clear and found the problem right way and refactor the code to pass the test.\
The thir thing I learned, is all the refactor/restructing/change that will be maded on the code, first write the test, confirm the fail is happening and the error is clear, as i saied above, because this make easy to think and visualize what need to be done and how need to be done.
